                        <p class="coc-text">Our events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and future events at the discretion of the Fore_Front organisers.</p>

                        <h2 class="coc-title">The Less Quick Version</h2>
                        <p class="coc-text">Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

                        <p class="coc-text">Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

                        <p class="coc-text">Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. All participants should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

                        <p class="coc-text">If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Fore_Front organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event (and future events) with no refund.</p>

                        <p class="coc-text">If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Fore_Front organizers immediately. Fore_Front organizers can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing, accessories, and/or badges.</p>

                        <p class="coc-text">Fore_Front organizers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>

                        <p class="coc-text">We expect participants to follow these rules at all Fore_Front events and within the Fore_Front community.</p>
